Look Mum, no VM
Finding harmony in my Windows life using the Linux subsystem

Who am I? (30 secs)
10 years sysadmin experience across JCU's 2 largest enterprise systems
Now a tech lead on one of those (kind of my dream job)

What is all this Linux subsystem madness? (30 secs)
Linux-compatible kernel interface with no actual Linux kernel code
Intended by Microsoft as a supplementary dev env for Windows users
Ability to run GNU user space, shell and command language, native command line tools, programming language interpreters, and even graphical applications via X11
Flavours available include Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, SUSE Enterprise Server, Debian, and more

Why did I decide to give it a go? (1 min)
Can't switch fully to Linux with any degree of ease as my job centres around enterprise, vendor-based, proprietary, Windows-hugging applications
But I neeeeeeeeeeed things to get things done!
bash, tmux, vim, pip, ipython, git, dig, grep, ssh-keygen...
Having 2 partitions on disk and a native Linux  install is no longer a feasible option due to time and flexibility restrictions
I'm bitter and twisted from years of running local memory-hungry VMs, or else fighting with IT and policy to get a standalone managed instance

How did I do it? (1 min)
Windows setup prerequisites (screenshots)
Microsoft store and installation (screenshots)
Bootstrapping (first update, must-have package installs)

What's fabulous? (30 secs)
(beautiful stone pic)
C:\ mount point
Memory usage
All your favourite packages; Git without drama, file analysis tools
The power of piping
Support for X11 - GUI if you need it
Benchmarking is very close to native Linux except for some I/O operations

What's not so great? (30 secs)
(overbalanced stone pic)
Windows files and Linux files are tricky creatures and sometimes don't play nicely when moved between worlds simply because of structural expectations
Not capable of running all Linux applications; 32- bit binaries, kernel modules (eg device drivers) as there is no Linux kernel code
X11 support is not exhaustive: issues with hardware acceleration and no audio support

But what does it all mean, Basil? (1 min)
My life is at least 100% better than it was before
My work is possible, whilst my dev environment is fully extensible with all the tools I need
(Tmux session)
This presentation was brought to you by my Linux subsystem
And best of all, by the laws of transference, my Windows box now has Super Cow Powers
